# Anti-Begal: B.E.G.A.L C2 DOS Exploit 

<img width="783" height="327" alt="Screenshot_2026-06-17_11_47_34" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fca8b736-2c45-48cd-8ff2-2ae011d1cbdc" />


**Anti-Begal** (`anti-begal.py`) is an Active Defense and tactical disruption script designed specifically to target and neutralize unauthorized instances of the **B.E.G.A.L** (Backdoor Exfiltration Gateway for Advanced Looting) Command and Control (C2) framework.

This script acts as the "vaccine" to the B.E.G.A.L framework. It exploits a deliberate architectural vulnerability (Resource Exhaustion via an unauthenticated endpoint) left within the original B.E.G.A.L source code to allow Blue Teams and Security Researchers to dismantle rogue C2 servers deployed by malicious actors.

## ⚠️ STRICT LEGAL AND ETHICAL DISCLAIMER

**This tool is released strictly for Educational Purposes, Active Defense Research, and Authorized Takedown Operations.**

1.  **Authorization is Mandatory:** You must have explicit, legal authorization to target the infrastructure you are aiming this script at (e.g., you are a system administrator defending your network, or participating in a sanctioned law enforcement takedown).
    
2.  **No Malicious Use:** Using this tool to perform Denial of Service (DoS) attacks against public network infrastructure or third-party servers without consent is illegal and strictly prohibited.
    
3.  **No Liability:** The developer (xsanlahci) assumes zero liability and is not responsible for any misuse, damage, or legal consequences caused by the use of this program.
    

**By using this software, you agree to these terms.**

##  How It Works (The Vulnerability)

The B.E.G.A.L C2 framework relies on an unauthenticated data collection endpoint (`/api/v1/collector`) to receive obfuscated (XOR + Base64) payload data from its bot agents.

Because the C2 server dynamically allocates memory (`ACTIVE_SESSIONS` and `CREDENTIAL_VAULT`) and creates a new SQLite database file for every unique bot UUID it receives, it is highly susceptible to Resource Exhaustion.

`anti-begal.py` automates the exploitation of this design flaw:

1.  **Payload Generation:** It replicates B.E.G.A.L's XOR cipher and Base64 encoding.
    
2.  **UUID Spoofing:** It generates thousands of fake bot UUIDs.
    
3.  **Junk Data Injection:** It injects massive amounts of junk data into the payload to amplify the storage impact.
    
4.  **Multi-Threading:** It floods the target `/api/v1/collector` endpoint with these spoofed, encrypted requests using concurrent threads.
    

### The Tactical Impact on the Target C2:

-   **Memory Exhaustion (OOM):** The Python Flask server's memory allocation will skyrocket, causing the C2 interface to lag severely or crash completely.
    
-   **Storage/Inode Starvation:** The target server's hard drive will be flooded with thousands of fake SQLite `.db` files, preventing the threat actor from saving actual stolen credentials.
    
-   **Data Poisoning:** The threat actor's credential vault will be rendered useless, buried under thousands of fake bot entries.
    

## 🚀 Usage

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.x
    
-   `requests` library (`pip install requests`)
    

### Running the Script

You can run the script interactively. It will prompt you for the necessary parameters.

```
python3 anti-begal.py

```

#### Interactive Prompts:

1.  **`insert target :`** The base URL of the rogue B.E.G.A.L C2 server (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:31337` or `https://rogue-c2.example.com`). The script will automatically append the `/api/v1/collector` path.
    
2.  **`insert key (press Enter for default):`** The XOR key used by the target C2. If you don't know it, pressing Enter will use the default B.E.G.A.L key. _(Note: Even with an incorrect key, the attack may still consume server resources processing the bad payload)._
    
3.  **`insert Threads (1-1000, default: 50):`** The number of concurrent attack threads. Higher numbers increase the flood rate but consume more CPU/RAM on your attacking machine. `50` to `200` is usually sufficient to disrupt a standard Flask deployment.

## 🛡️ Mitigation (How to Defend B.E.G.A.L)

If you are running B.E.G.A.L for educational purposes in a lab and want to patch this "Kill-Switch":

1.  **Implement Rate Limiting:** Add Flask-Limiter to restrict the number of requests per IP to the `/api/v1/collector` endpoint.
    
2.  **Authentication/Pre-Shared Key:** Require a pre-shared cryptographic token in the request header before processing the payload or allocating memory.
    
3.  **Payload Size Limits:** Strictly enforce a maximum content-length for incoming requests.
